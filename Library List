This is a list of all libraries/classes that need to be written for the UAV.

If there is not a name below a class, you may add your name if you are confident that you can write it yourself.

All libraries for Arduino Mini:
--------------
1)  Sonar Sensor (Ranger)
      -Eric M
2)  Infrared Sensor
      -

3)  Task Queue
      -Eric M.
4)  Scheduler
      -Eric M.

5)  Arducopter communicator
      -
6)  Base station communicator
      -

7)  Collision Avoidance
      -


For Arducopter board:
1)  Arduino Mini communicator
      -Eric M.


Notes:

All libraries MUST follow the same coding style! They must all have:
*An empty constructor
*Init() method
*Tasks that are added to the scheduler MUST be: static void DoTask(void *c)
*All sensor libraries must have idential interfaces! Refer to the Ranger library as a template
*Both communicators must also have identical interfaces
*Any class that all others need to access must be stored as a global pointer and must have a 
  name that starts with an underscore e.g.: TaskQueue *_logicalName

All libraries must only contain ONE class! If a library needs two classes, split it into two libraries!
  --If you think you have an exception to this rule, ask the group or email Eric Middleton.

If you are unsure of any of the above rules (or anything else), check any existing libraries first.
If that doesn't answer your question, email Eric Middleton.
